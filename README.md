## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to help an investor make a business decisions about opening an ice cream shop with surf gear named "Surf n' Shake Shop" in Oahu. Since the weather can vary so much on an island,it is important to research the island's weather history and patterns where the shop might be located. The best location for the shop is somehwere that has sunny days most of the year. The data-driven decisions will be based on temperature and rainfall for the past 7 years from 2010-2017,  June and December. These 2 months are far apart enough to ensure we have good conditions year-round.


## Results

The analysis focuses on the temperature and rainfall from six different weather stations On Oahu, Hawaii from 2010-2017 and June and December. We reviewed the activity from August 23, 2016 - August 23, 2017. The average was 18% based on 2,021 observations. Therefore, Oahu was mostly sunny throughout the day and experienced low rainfall. We also found that  the average temperature throughout the year was 72°F with a low of 54°F and a high of 85°F. We then found that the average temperature was in the 70's, and Both June and December showed similar min/max and average temperatures.



## Summary 

The investor's main concern was that the location would get rained out too frequently, and therefore lower their number of operable das. Comparing the June and December weather patterns, the temperatures and precipitation averages are reasonably close. The temperature data is not strongly skewed for either month. The ratio of the temperatures to the precipitation for the two months is also reasonably similar with few outliers over 3 inches of precipitation. Therefore the data supports opening a Surf and Ice Cream shop year-round.
